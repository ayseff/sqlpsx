New SQLPSX_Install Document

Folder -> SQLPSX_Installer_Project
		
		Folders

		|--> Add_files_to_SQLPSX  (these files need to be added to your SQLPSX.zip file)

		|--> Current_SQLPSX_ZIP	 (here's a copy of your SQLPSX.zip file)

		|--> Logos  ( here's Laerte's logo and a bmp file I created from it)

		|--> Source ( Here the main source code of SQLPSX_Install built in Sapien's Primalform ).

		|--> SQLPSX_V2_Install ( This is the folder you need to zip and distribute. SQLPSX_2.1.zip is already included in it. )


What's included in the "Add_files_to_SQLPSX" folder?

There are two files:
1. Ionic.Zip.dll - free codeplex dll for extracting (& zip) files.
2. SQLPSX_LoadModules.ps1 - This *script will load all the SQPSX modules that exist in the x:\Windows\..\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\SQLPSX.. folder.

*note: This script line will be installed in either of the existing profiles (User or Windows) BUT is commented out so the user can manually enable 
it after the installation.  For the future I will include a menu so they can pick to load or not.



Additional notes:

1. I have successfully test this solution on: Windows 7(64/32bit), Windows 2008 SP1 (32bit), Windows 2008R2 (x:\Windows), and Windows XP.
2. There's two installer for either 32 or 64 bit environments.
3. Also, I have tested that it will install the modules if the Windows location is not c:\.
4. The folder "SQLPSX_V2 Install" is the one your zipped and distribute:
     1. This will build a folder with the files you need to pick to install SQLPSX_v2.1 using either: SQLPSX_Install_32.exe or SQLPSX_Install_64.exe
5. Simple install doc included.

Changes log - 0.1 - 03/18/2010, 1734 - Max Trinidad
1. Add the "Close" Button.
2. Rename SQLPSX folder from "..\Module\SQLPSX_V2" to "..\Module\SQLPSX".
3. Create a single installer, its 32 bit but should install OK on 64bit machines.
4. Delete both SQLPSX_Install32 and 64 exe's.

Changes log - 0.1a - 03/18/2010, 17:58 - Max Trinidad
1. Put back both Installer 32/64 because the 32bit will not create the SQLPSX folder.
